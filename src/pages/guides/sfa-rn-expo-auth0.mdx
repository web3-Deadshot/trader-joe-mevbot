  image="https://web3auth.io/docs/guides/banners/sfa-auth0.png"
  slug="/guides/sfa-rn-expo-auth0"
/>

This guide will cover the basics of how to set up your Web3Auth SDK and Auth0 account for the
integration and provide you with the links on how to develop a basic React Native Expo application
on the blockchain of your choice.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx degit Web3Auth/web3auth-core-kit-examples/single-factor-auth-react-native/sfa-rn-expo-auth0-example sfa-rn-auth0-demo && cd sfa-rn-auth0-demo && npm install && npm run start
```

## How it works?

Single Factor Auth SDKs allow for the integration of a single factor of authentication, such as
social login, into your dApp. They are designed to be simple to use and can be integrated into your
dApp with minimal effort, allowing you to directly use the Web3Auth Network for Wallet Management.
This is one of the most common use cases of Web3Auth, however, it is semi-custodial in nature, since
the key is custodial to the Auth Provider and the Web3Auth Network.

- The first step for the application is to get the user authenticated by a login provider(here,
  Google) and get the user's `idToken`.
- Once the social login is successful, depending on whether the user has enabled **Multi-Factor
  Authentication(MFA)** or not, the key is generated.
- If the user has not enabled MFA, we use the `@web3auth/single-factor-auth` SDK to retrieve the
  private key shares from the Web3Auth auth network nodes and reconstruct the private key.
- If the user has enabled MFA, an error message is shown that the user has enabled MFA and in this
  case, they should be using the Web3Auth Plug and Play Web SDKs.

## Using the Web3Auth SFA Web SDK

To use the Web3Auth SFA Web SDK, you need to add `@web3auth/single-factor-auth` to your project.

### Installation

For this project, you need to add the following Web3Auth dependencies to your package.json

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/single-factor-auth-react-native @web3auth/base @web3auth/ethereum-provider ethers react-native-auth0 expo-secure-store
```

#### Understanding the Dependencies

##### `@web3auth/base`

Since we're using typescript, we need the **`@web3auth/base`** package to provide the types of the
different variables we'll be using throughout the app-building process. This reduces errors to a
very large extent.

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/base
```

##### `@web3auth/ethereum-provider`

This package is used to provide the Ethereum provider to the Web3Auth SDK. This is required to
interact with the blockchain.

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/ethereum-provider
```

##### `@web3auth/single-factor-auth-react-native`

This package is the core package for Single Factor Auth React Native SDK.

```shell
npm install --save @web3auth/single-factor-auth-react-native
```

##### `react-native-auth0`

This package is used to provide the Auth0 SDK to the app. This is required to retrieve the `idToken`
from Auth0 as the login provider.

```shell
npm install --save @auth0/auth0-react
```

##### `ethers`

This package is used to interact with the blockchain.

```shell
npm install --save web3
```

#### `expo-secure-store`

This package is used to store the private key shares in the device's secure storage.

```shell
npm install --save expo-secure-store
```

#### Configure Auth0 for React Native

Please follow the guide here to
[configure Auth0 for React Native](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native/react-native/00-login).

### Initialization

Once installed, your Web3Auth application needs to be initialized. Initialization is a multi-step
process where we add all the config details for Web3Auth SDK:

##### Importing the packages

```tsx
import { IProvider } from "@web3auth/base";
import { EthereumPrivateKeyProvider } from "@web3auth/ethereum-provider";
import Web3Auth from "@web3auth/single-factor-auth-react-native";
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import * as SecureStore from "expo-secure-store";
import { Auth0Provider, useAuth0 } from "react-native-auth0";
```

##### Instantiate the Web3Auth SFA React Native SDK

```tsx
import { IProvider } from "@web3auth/base";
import { EthereumPrivateKeyProvider } from "@web3auth/ethereum-provider";
import Web3Auth from "@web3auth/single-factor-auth-react-native";
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import * as SecureStore from "expo-secure-store";
import { Auth0Provider, useAuth0 } from "react-native-auth0";

const clientId =
  "BPi5PB_UiIZ-cPz1GtV5i1I2iOSOHuimiXBI0e-Oe_u6X3oVAbCiAZOTEBtTXw4tsluTITPqA8zMsfxIKMjiqNQ"; // get from https://dashboard.web3auth.io

const chainConfig = {
  chainId: "0x1",
  displayName: "Ethereum Mainnet",
  chainNamespace: CHAIN_NAMESPACES.EIP155,
  tickerName: "Ethereum",
  ticker: "ETH",
  decimals: 18,
  rpcTarget: "https://rpc.ankr.com/eth",
  blockExplorer: "https://etherscan.io",
};

// Initialising Web3Auth Single Factor Auth SDK
const web3auth = new Web3Auth(SecureStore, {
  clientId,
  web3AuthNetwork: "sapphire_mainnet",
  usePnPKey: false, // By default, this sdk returns CoreKitKey
});

const privateKeyProvider = new EthereumPrivateKeyProvider({
  config: { chainConfig },
});
```

Here, we're using the `chainConfig` property to set the `chainId` and `chainNamespace` among other
parameters. The `chainId` and `chainNamespace` are the id and the namespace respectively of the
chain you're connecting to. We've initialized them for EVM for this guide. You can find the list of
available providers [here](/sdk/providers/) to select from.

Additionally, sometimes you might face clogging in the network because the test network is a bit
clogged at that point. To avoid this, we can use the property `rpcTarget` and pass over the URL of
the node you want to connect to.

#### Initializing the Web3Auth SDK

```tsx
web3authSfa.init(privateKeyProvider);
```

### Authentication

#### Getting the `idToken` from Auth0 upon login

```tsx
const { authorize, clearSession, getCredentials } = useAuth0();

const signInWithAuth0 = async () => {
  try {
    // @ts-ignore
    await authorize(
      { scope: "openid profile email" },
      { customScheme: "auth0.com.web3authsfaauth0" },
      { responseType: "token id_token" },
    );
    const credentials = await getCredentials();

    return credentials.idToken;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};
```

<ParseIdtokenGetSub />

#### Initializing the Web3Auth SDK

The next step is to initialize the Web3Auth SDK. We now have all the parameters that are needed to
call the `connect` method of the Web3Auth SDK.

```tsx
const idToken = await signInWithAuth0();

const parsedToken = parseToken(idToken);
setUserInfo(parsedToken);

const verifierId = sub;
await web3auth.connect({
  verifier: "w3a-auth0-demo", // e.g. `web3auth-sfa-verifier` replace with your verifier name, and it has to be on the same network passed in init().
  verifierId, // e.g. `Yux1873xnibdui` or `name@email.com` replace with your verifier id(sub or email)'s value.
  idToken,
});
```

:::info

Since we are directly using Single Factor Auth SDK to log in, the Web3Auth `getUserInfo` function
won't work. We need to get the user details directly from the `idToken`.

:::

<UserInfoFromIdtoken />

### Logout

Logging out your user is as simple as calling the `logout` function on the Web3Auth SDK.

```tsx
await clearSession();
await web3authSfa.logout();
```
