The Web3Auth dashboard summarizes various aspects of Web3Auth, including information about projects,
verifiers, billings, and profile setup. Using this dashboard lets users get an overview of their
Web3Auth-related activities and can easily collaborate with others to build better applications.
Since collaboration is essential for creating successful apps, the Web3Auth dashboard helps users
work together more effectively.

## Getting Started

To begin using the [Web3Auth dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io), log in using one of your
social accounts or use your email address. Please be aware that the login process utilizes the
Web3Auth infrastructure with a customized user interface to generate a wallet for you.

    alt="Dashboard Billing Teams Choice of Plans"
  />
</div>

## Migration of Verifiers

Users can now attach old verifiers to projects with a one-time process from the verifier tab in our
new dashboard.

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src={MigrateVerifiers}
    style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }}
    alt="Migrate Verifiers to a Project."
  />
</div>

**To move the verifiers to a project, follow the steps below:**

1. Click on the three dots located on the verifier that you want to move.
2. Select "Move to project".
3. Choose the project(s) where you want to move the verifier.

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src={VerifierToMigrate}
    style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }}
    alt="Verifier to Migrate."
  />
</div>
<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src={VerifierAfterMigration}
    style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }}
    alt="Verifier after Migrating to a project."
  />
</div>

In case the **"Move to project"** button is disabled, it means the verifier needs to be moved to a
new project with the same environment as the verifier and you may not have it. So please try
creating a project with the same environment as the verifier and then try moving the verifier to
that project.

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src={VerifierWithNoProjects}
    style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }}
    alt="Verifier with no projects."
  />
</div>

Once the verifier is moved, you will see the projects it has been moved into under the "Projects"
column. As far as you see a project logo/name under the "Projects" column, it means the verifier has
been moved to that project and no further action is required. But if a verifer does not have any
project under the "Projects" column, it means the verifier has not been moved to any project and you
need to move it to a project. Else it will be deleted from the dashboard after **October 31st,
2023**.

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src={VerifierProjectList}
    style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }}
    alt="Verifier Project List"
  />
</div>

**Finally, remember that you can attach the same verifier to multiple projects if needed.**
