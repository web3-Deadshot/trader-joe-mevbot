You must have the required access permissions to perform any actions on the Web3Auth dashboard, such
as collaborating on a project or adjusting your organization's billing settings. These permissions
determine what you can and cannot do on the platform, such as editing project settings or accessing
billing information. To manage these permissions, you can assign roles to organization members. A
role is a predefined set of permissions assigned to one or more users. By assigning the appropriate
roles to organization members, you can ensure they have the necessary access to perform their tasks
effectively while maintaining security and control over your Web3Auth projects.

## Organization Roles

In your organization, there are four different roles: Owner, Admin, Member, and Billing.

- **Owner**: The owner can manage project settings, manage organization, manage billing, and delete
  the organization. If you create an account, you automatically become the owner, and ownership can
  be transferable. There can only be one owner at a time.

- **Admin**: Admins can manage project settings, organization, and billing in the organization but
  cannot delete the organization.

- **Member**: Members can only view projects and do not have permission to manage projects, members,
  or billing.

- **Billing**: The Billing role is responsible for managing the billing settings of your
  organization, and there can only be one billing role at a time.

## Invite members to your organization

To invite someone to your organization, you must be the owner of the organization. To do so, click
on `Settings` on the sidebar menu and then select the `Members` tab. From this screen, you'll be
able to see the list of members in your organization. To invite someone, click on the `Add Member`
button and enter their email address along with the role you want to assign them.

If the person you're inviting is already a user of Web3Auth, they'll receive an email with a link to
join your organization. If they're not a user, they'll receive an email with a link to create an
account and join your organization.

## Seats and billing

Web3Auth's base plan is available only for individuals. If you are a team of 2 or more, you will
need to upgrade to growth plan and above.

- The Web3Auth dashboard allows you to easily add new members to your organization. To add members,
  follow the steps outlined in
  [#invite-members-to-your-organization](#invite-members-to-your-organization)

- Once you have added a member to your organization, they will receive an email inviting them to
  join. They will need to log in to the Web3Auth dashboard using their existing account or create a
  new account to accept the invitation.

- It's important to note that there is a five-minute link expiry for the invitation email. If the
  link expires, the member will need to request a new invitation. See
  [#invitation-options](#invitation-options) to manage invitations.

- After accepting the invitation, the new member will have access to the Web3Auth dashboard with the
  permissions assigned to their role. It's important to review and manage these permissions to
  ensure that team members have the appropriate level of access.

- If a member's role requires approval from another member, they will receive an email asking for
  approval before they can access the dashboard. It's important to keep track of pending invitations
  and approvals to ensure that team members can access the dashboard as needed.

- Lastly, it's important to keep track of your team's seats and billing. Each team member requires a
  seat, and you may need to adjust your billing settings if you exceed your plan's limits. You can
  view and manage your team's billing information in the `Billing` section of the dashboard.
