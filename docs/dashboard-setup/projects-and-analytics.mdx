Create a new project in the Web3Auth dashboard to obtain a Client ID. During this process, you will
be prompted to select the Web3Auth product you intend to use and the Platform, environment, and
Chains that suit your needs.

Web3Auth offers a "Plug and Play" feature that provides a pre-built user interface and user
experience for integrating with your project. This feature makes it easy and efficient to integrate
Web3Auth, eliminating the need to design the entire process from scratch.

The "Core Kit" refers to the underlying SDKs of the Plug and Play. This option offers the maximum
level of customization.

The project page on the dashboard will appear similar to this:

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src={DashboardProjectList}
    style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }}
    alt="Dashboard Project List"
  />
</div>

## Create a new project

### Name your project

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src={CreateProjectName}
    style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }}
    alt="Create Project Name"
  />
</div>

### Select a web3auth product

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src={CreateProjectProduct}
    style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }}
    alt="Create Project Select Product"
  />
</div>

### Select a platform type

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src={CreateProjectPlatformType}
    style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }}
    alt="Create Project Platform Type"
  />
</div>

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src={CreateProjectPlatformTypeFilled}
    style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }}
    alt="Create Project Platform Type Filled"
  />
</div>

### Select an environment

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src={CreateProjectEnvironment}
    style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }}
    alt="Create Project Select Environment"
  />
</div>

### Select chains

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src={CreateProjectChains}
    style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }}
    alt="Create Project Chains"

</div>

## Diving into a Web3Auth project

A project contains the following details:

### Client ID

The Project ID is a distinctive identifier for your project and is used to identify your project
within the Web3Auth dashboard. You will need this ID when initializing the Web3Auth SDK within your
application. Once you create a project, the Project ID is automatically generated for you. It is
important to copy and include this value in your initialization code to ensure seamless integration
with Web3Auth.

### Client Secret

The Project Secret Key is a confidential code utilized to verify your project's authenticity. Like
the Project ID, the Secret Key is also generated automatically upon project creation.

### Add a new whitelist URL

The Whitelist URL is the address you wish to authorize for your project. When implementing Web3Auth,
it is important to whitelist the specific URLs from which you intend to make calls for user
authentication. By doing so, you can ensure that these activities are conducted securely and
efficiently. Remember to whitelist all relevant URLs to guarantee seamless integration with
Web3Auth.

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img
    src={DashboardWhiteListURL}
    style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }}
    alt="Dashboard Whitelist"
  />
</div>

### Archive a project

You can archive a project by clicking the "Archive" button on the project page. This action will
remove the project from the dashboard and prevent you from using the Client ID to authenticate
users. You can unarchive a project by clicking the "Unarchive" button from the archive page.

## Project Analytics

<div style={{ flexBasis: "300px", flexGrow: "1", textAlign: "center" }}>
  <img src={Analytics} style={{ alignSelf: "center", maxWidth: "100%" }} alt="Project Analytics" />
</div>

Project analytics is a system that collects and examines data related to user engagement and usage.
The system includes several key components, such as the number of logins, the count of monthly
active wallets, a monthly active wallets overview in the form of a pie chart, verifier details, and
the ability to view data for different time periods. These tools offer valuable insights into
document management and user engagement strategies.
