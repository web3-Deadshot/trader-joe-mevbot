  every aspect, from the modal appearance to the user flow, including MFA screens, to maintain
  consistency across all user interactions.

- **Comprehensive Management:** With Web3Auth's whitelabeling options, you gain full control over
  the authentication experience, ensuring it is not only branded but also intuitive for users. This
  approach minimizes the need for additional UI development and aligns closely with your
  application's design principles.

## Core Kit SDKs Whitelabeling

- **Complete Control:** The Core Kit SDKs go a step further by providing total invisibility of
  Web3Auth's underlying mechanisms. Developers have the freedom to design their authentication pages
  and flows, offering unparalleled customization.
- **No Redirection:** Distinguishing itself from the Plug and Play model, the Core Kit eliminates
  the need for user redirection to `auth.web3auth.io` for authentication, ensuring all processes are
  kept within your application's ecosystem.

## Wallet Services Whitelabeling

- **Comprehensive Customization:** For Wallet Services, whitelabeling extends to modifying the
  entire user interface, including logos, color schemes, and visibility of specific sections,
  ensuring a branded experience throughout.
- **Application Identity:** Tailor the appearance of wallet service components, such as chain logos
  and the dApp logo, to reinforce your application's brand identity across all user interactions.

## Language Customization and Localization (l10n)

A significant aspect of Web3Auth's whitelabeling capabilities is its support for multiple languages,
enhancing accessibility and user engagement across diverse demographics.

- **Multiple Languages Support:** Web3Auth supports localization for a variety of languages
  including English (en), Spanish (es), German (de), Chinese (zh), Japanese (ja), Korean (ko),
  French (fr), Portuguese (pt), and Dutch (nl).
- **Open Source Contributions:** The Web3Auth locales are maintained in an open-source repository,
  inviting contributions from the community to add or refine language support.
