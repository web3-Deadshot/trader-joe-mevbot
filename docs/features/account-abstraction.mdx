Account Abstraction (AA) revolutionizes Web3 authentication by integrating externally owned accounts
(EOAs) and smart contracts, offering a more seamless and secure way for decentralized applications
(dApps) to interact with users. These AA-powered smart contract wallets have multiple benefits:

- **Ecosystem Evolution** Driven by the ERC-4337 proposal, AA aims for its adoption across the
  Ethereum network, striving for universal account abstraction.
- **Decentralized Integrity:** Maintains decentralization and censorship resistance, core principles
  of blockchain technology, through the application of AA.
- **Gas Fee Sponsorship:** Offers the ability for users to perform gasless transactions, with fees
  sponsored by the dApp developers, reducing the barrier to entry for users.
- **Sophisticated Recovery and Transfer Options:** Smart contract-based wallets can implement
  complex recovery methods and ownership transfer mechanisms, offering enhanced security and
  flexibility.

## Understanding EOAs & Smart Contract Wallets

[EOA, or an externally-owned account](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/) is a type
of Ethereum account that is controlled by a private key. EOAs can be created through
Web3Auth-powered social logins, or by using external wallets such as MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet,
Rainbow Wallet, etc.

On the other hand, there are <b>contract accounts</b> that are controlled by smart contract codes
and do not have their own private key. Safe's smart wallet is a contract account that has

<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/account-abstraction/" target="_blank">
  {" "}
  enhanced capabilities, such as gas sponsorship and batched transactions.{" "}
</a>

Since contract accounts do not have their own private key, they require a <b>signer</b> to initiate
transaction flows and produce signatures. Signers are usually EOAs that authorize actions taken by
the contract account via a signature.

## Web3Auth's approach to Account Abstraction

Web3Auth leverages the combination of Multi-Party Computation based social login EOAs with AA-based
smart contract wallet accounts. By incorporating MPC, AA's security and functionality are
significantly enhanced. MPC distributes the validation process across multiple entities, ensuring no
single party can dominate transaction processes, thus bolstering security while maintaining
user-friendliness. This results in:

- **Enhanced Recoverability and UX:** Utilizes social login-based MPC EOAs to offer superior
  recoverability and a streamlined user experience, negating the need for external wallet
  management.
- **Simplified Access and Management:** Facilitates easier account access and management through
  social logins and advanced recovery mechanisms, promoting broader Web3 adoption.

## Using Account Abstraction with Web3Auth

Web3Auth's AA integration is designed to be developer-friendly, offering a range of tools and
resources to simplify the process. All the major Account Abstraction providers have integrated
Web3Auth into their login stacks, enhancing the accessibility and security of their platforms.
Web3Auth is proud to be a part of this transformative movement, working closely with leading AA
providers to ensure a seamless, secure login experience. Below are highlights from a few of these
collaborations:
