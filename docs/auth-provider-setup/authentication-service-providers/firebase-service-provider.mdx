## Set up Firebase

If you haven't already, set up Firebase for your project. It is the mandatory step before we proceed
further. After the basic setup, we'll learn how to create a custom verifier for the Web3Auth
project. You can follow the link below to set up Firebase for your project. For React native, you
can set up Firebase for Android and iOS separately. If we are missing any platform/framework, you
can always [check out Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/libraries).

export const FirebaseSetup = [
  {
    name: "",
    description: "",
    tiles: [
      {
        key: "web",
        title: "Web",
        icon: "logo-js.png",
        path: "https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup",
      },
      {
        key: "android",
        title: "Android (Kotlin)",
        icon: "logo-android.png",
        path: "https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup",
      },
      {
        key: "ios",
        title: "iOS",
        icon: "logo-apple.png",
        path: "https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup",
      },
      {
        key: "flutter",
        title: "Flutter",
        icon: "logo-flutter.png",
        path: "https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup",
      },
      {
        key: "unity",
        title: "Unity",
        icon: "logo-unity.png",
        path: "https://firebase.google.com/docs/unity/setup",
      },
    ],
  },
];

## Set up a Custom verifier

## Integration

After you have set up Firebase and the corresponding Custom verifier in the Web3Auth Dashboard, you
can follow the guides to integrate it into your project. The support for using a custom verifier is
not limited to the below SDKs and platforms. You can check out our SDK references to learn how to
use a custom verifier.

  {
