This guide will help you to set up Auth0 service prvoider:

## Set up Auth0

If you haven't already, set up Auth0 for your project. It is the mandatory step before we proceed
further. After the basic setup, we'll learn how to create a custom verifier for the Web3Auth
project. You can follow the link below to set up Auth0 for your project. If we are missing any
platform/framework, you can always
[check out Auth0 documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native#webapp).

export const Auth0Setup = [
  {
    name: "",
    description: "",
    tiles: [
      {
        key: "web",
        title: "Web",
        icon: "logo-js.png",
        path: "https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/vanillajs/interactive",
      },
      {

        path: "https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native/android/interactive",
      },
      {

        icon: "logo-apple.png",
        path: "https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native/ios-swift/interactive",
      },
      {
        key: "flutter",

        icon: "logo-flutter.png",
        path: "https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native/flutter/interactive",
      },

      },
    ],
  },
];

## Set up a Custom Verifier

1. Create an Auth0 verifier by choosing `Social Login Providers` and selecting `Auth0` from the
   **Login Provider** dropdown.

2. Select the `Authentication Type` from the dropdown based on your application needs.

   > Note: For Email Password and Email Passwordless authentication, the `email_verified = true`
   > condition is added to the JWT verification. To avoid JWT params mismatch error, you can use any
   > other Authentication Type.

3. Enter the `Auth0 Client ID` and `Auth0 Domain` from your Auth0 application. See how to create a
   new Auth0 application [here](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/).

4. Fill the `Auth0 Client ID` and `Auth0 Domain` details and select `Sub` or `Email` as the JWT
   Verifier ID.

5. Click on the `Create Verifier` button to create your Auth0 verifier.

## Integration

After you have set up Auth0 and the corresponding Custom verifier in the Web3Auth Dashboard, you can
follow the guides to integrate it into your project. The support for using a custom verifier is not
limited to the below SDKs and platforms. You can check out our SDK references to learn how to use a
custom verifier.
