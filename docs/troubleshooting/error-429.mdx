import Error429 from "@site/static/images/error-429.png";

While setting up Web3Auth, there might be cases you will be getting an JSON-RPC error, which comes
from the overloading of our test node server.

The error might look something like this:

<img
  style={{ display: "block", maxHeight: "400px", marginBottom: "20px" }}
  src={Error429}
  alt="Error 429 (Infura RPC Endpoint) - Troubleshoot"
/>

In that case, we recommend you to pass on your own node server in the `rpcTarget` value while
Instantiating Web3Auth, that can be easily created by using a service like
[Infura](https://app.infura.io/login), [Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/endpoints),
[dRPC](https://drpc.org/chainlist) etc.

## For EVM Based Chains

Other than creating your own node server, for testing purposes, you can use any of the available RPC
URLs for any of the EVM Chains you're using. These RPCs can be found on
[Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/).

### Example

```javascript
const web3auth = new Web3Auth({
  clientId,
  chainConfig: {
    chainNamespace: CHAIN_NAMESPACES.EIP155,
    chainId: "0x1",
    rpcTarget: "https://rpc.ankr.com/eth", // This is the public RPC we have added, please pass on your own endpoint while creating an app
  },
});
```

## For Solana Blockchain

[Quicknode](https://www.quicknode.com/endpoints) can help you create your own node server. Also,
Ankr has a [public Solana RPC](https://www.ankr.com/protocol/public/solana/) available which you can
use for testing purposes as mentioned below:

### Example

```javascript
const web3auth = new Web3Auth({
  clientId,
  chainConfig: {
    chainNamespace: CHAIN_NAMESPACES.SOLANA,
    chainId: "0x1", // Please use 0x1 for Mainnet, 0x2 for Testnet, 0x3 for Devnet
    rpcTarget: "https://rpc.ankr.com/solana", // This is the public RPC we have added, please pass on your own endpoint while creating an app
  },
});
```

## For Other Blockchains

You don't need to pass any chainConfig other than `chainNamespace`. You can easily export the
private key from Web3Auth in the user scope and use it for making your custom RPC Calls.
