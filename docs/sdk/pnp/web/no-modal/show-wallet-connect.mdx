For enabling interoperability with Wallet Connect, ie. connecting your W3A-generated wallet to other
dApps which have Wallet Connect integration, you can use the `showWalletConnectScanner()` method.
This method uses the Wallet Connect `copy and paste` flow, in which you can directly copy the QR
Code details from a dApp like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io) and paste it into your shown modal.
