## [`@web3auth/no-modal`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/no-modal)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/no-modal
```

### Consider adding `@web3auth/base` to your project

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/base
```

This package gives access to common types and interfaces for Web3Auth. This comes in handy by
providing you a standard way of importing the values you need to work with the SDKs. We highly
recommend using it while working with `typescript`.

## Troubleshooting

### Bundler Issues: Missing Dependencies

You might face issues mentioning that certain dependencies are missing within the browser
environment. These are node dependencies that need to be polyfilled in your application, to enable
Web3Auth functionalities. Furthermore, your bundler needs to be reconfigured to use them while
building the app. We have created guides for different bundlers to help you with this issue:
