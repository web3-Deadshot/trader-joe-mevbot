## [`@web3auth/modal`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/modal)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/modal
```

### Add `@web3auth/base` to your project

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/base
```

This package gives access to common types and interfaces for Web3Auth. This comes in handy by
providing you a standard way of importing the values you need to work with the SDKs. We highly
recommend using it while working with `Typescript`.

### Add `@web3auth/ethereum-provider` to your project

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/ethereum-provider
```

This package gives access to `EthereumPrivateKeyProvider` class, which accepts a secp251k1 private
key and returns EIP1193 compatible provider. The EIP1193 provider can be used with various wallet
sdks. This reference guide demonstrates use of Web3Auth with EVM compatible blockchains. To use
Web3Auth with different blockchain ecosystems like Solana, XRPL, and others please use their
respective providers.

## Troubleshooting

### Bundler Issues: Missing Dependencies

You might face issues mentioning that certain dependencies are missing within the browser
environment. These are node dependencies that need to be polyfilled in your application, to enable
Web3Auth functionalities. Furthermore, your bundler needs to be reconfigured to use them while
building the app. We have created guides for different bundlers to help you with this issue:
