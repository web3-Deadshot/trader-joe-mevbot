Once you've installed and successfully initialized Web3Auth, you can use it to authenticate your
users. Further, you can use the native provider given by Web3Auth to connect the users to the
respective blockchain network.

Natively, the instance of `Web3Auth` _(referred to as `web3auth` in our examples)_ returns the
following functions:

- `connect()` - Showing the Modal and Logging in the User
- `provider()` - Returns the native provider that can be used to make different blockchain
  transactions.
- `connected()` - Returns `true` or `false` depending on whether the web3auth instance is available
  or not.
- `getUserInfo()` - Getting the User's Information
- `authenticateUser()` - Getting the idToken from Web3Auth
- `addChain()` - Add chain config details to the connected adapter.
- `switchChain()` - Switch chain as per chainId already added to chain config.
- `getAdapter()` - Get the connected adapter instance.
- `configureAdapter()` - Configure the adapter instance.
- `clearCache()` - Clear the cache.
- `addPlugin()` - Add a plugin to Web3Auth.
- `logout()` - Logging out the User

## Logging in the User

#### `connect()`

You can show the modal in the browser by calling `connect()` function on `web3auth` instance. Your
user can choose their preferred login method and access your application.

```javascript
await web3auth.connect();
```

#### Returns

```tsx
connect(): Promise<IProvider | null>;
```

On successful login, the `connect()` function returns a `IProvider` instance. This instance contains
the respective provider corresponding to your selected blockchain. You can use this provider to
connect your user to the blockchain and make transactions.

On unsuccessful login, this function will return a `null` value.

:::tip

Read more about connecting your users with the selected blockchain in the
[Providers SDK Reference](/sdk/providers).
