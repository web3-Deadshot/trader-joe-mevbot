After installation, the next step to using Web3Auth Core Kit tKey SDK is to Initialize the SDK. The
Initialization takes a few steps, including initiating the tKey SDK with the service provider and
modules.

- [Configuration of Service Provider](#configuring-service-provider)
- [Configuration of Storage Layer](#configuring-storage-layer)
- [Configuration of Modules](#configuring-modules)
- [Instantiation of tKey](#instantiating-tkey)
- [Initialisation of Service Provider](#initializing-service-provider)

:::note

These are the most critical steps where you must pass on different parameters according to the need
of your project.

## Configuring Service Provider

Service Provider in `tKey` is used for generating a [**Share A**](/sdk/core-kit/tkey), i.e. the
private key share managed by a wallet service provider via their authentication flows. This share in
our [wallet infrastructure](/infrastructure/) refers to the social login aspect, where we associate
a private key share with the user's social login, enabling the seamless login experience.

#### [`@tkey/service-provider-sfa`](https://npmjs.com/package/@tkey/service-provider-sfa)

In the Web3Auth Core Kit tKey SDK setup, you have to use the Web3Auth SFA Service Provider
(`@tkey/service-provider-sfa`), which is basically a wrapper around the
[Single Factor Auth Web](/sdk/core-kit/sfa-web/) library implementing Web3Auth's Social Login
feature as a service provider and enabling you to associate the social login of the user as one of
the shares.

#### `Web3AuthOptions`

<Web3AuthOptions />

:::warning

Please note that the some of the parameters mentioned in the type description within the SFA Web SDK
are not valid for the service provider. We have only mentioned the ones that are applicable.

#### Usage

<SFASPInstanceExample />

## Configuring Storage Layer

The Storage Layer refers to the Metadata Storage, which is used to store the metadata information of
the shares generated by the tKey SDK.

#### [`@tkey/storage-layer-torus`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tkey/storage-layer-torus)

:::info

By default, we recommend using the Web3Auth (Torus) Metadata Storage URL as your default storage.
However, if you want to own the storage layer, you can contact
[our team](https://calendly.com/web3auth/meeting-with-web3auth) to help you set that up.

#### Usage

## Configuring Modules

<ModulesDescription />

## Instantiating tKey

#### Import the `ThresholdKey` class from `@tkey/default`

```javascript
import ThresholdKey from "@tkey/core";
```

#### Assign the `ThresholdKey` class to a variable

```javascript
const tKey = new ThresholdKey(TKeyArgs);
```

This ThresholdKey constructor takes an object with `TKeyArgs` as input.

### Parameters

<TKeyArgs />

### Example

<TKeyInstanceExample />

## Initializing Service Provider

You need to initialize your Service Provider within your constructor function to use it while
logging your user in through the social accounts. This is done by calling the `init()` function
within the `tKey` instance's `serviceProvider` property.

```javascript
tKeyInstance.serviceProvider.init(params: PrivateKeyProvider);
```

### Parameters

#### `PrivateKeyProvider`

The `init` function in SFAServiceProvider needs a `PrivateKeyProvider` as a parameter. It can accept
any of the providers mentioned in our [Providers](/sdk/providers/) documentation

### Example
