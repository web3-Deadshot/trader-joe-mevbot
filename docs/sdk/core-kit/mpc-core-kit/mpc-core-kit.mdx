Web3Auth's [`@web3auth/mpc-core-kit`](https://github.com/Web3Auth/mpc-core-kit) SDK is simple and
easy-to-use SDK, that helps you implement Web3Auth's MPC features while giving you the flexibility
to customize the UI and UX of the authentication process.

## This Documentation is based on [`3.0.0`](https://github.com/Web3Auth/mpc-core-kit/releases/tag/v2.3.3) version of the SDK.

## Requirements

### Web

- Basic knowledge of JavaScipt
- This is a frontend SDK and can only run in a browser environment.

### React Native

- React Native Release 0.71 and above (for Bare React Native Workflow)
- iOS Platform Target Version 14 and above
- Android Target SDK Version 31 and above

:::note

The minimum [pricing plan](https://web3auth.io/pricing.html) to use this SDK in a production
environment is the **Enterprise Plan**. However, you can use this SDK with all features enabled in
the **development environment for free**.

## Web3Auth MPC Infrastructure Components

The Web3Auth infrastructure is designed to ensure the security of user keys. Instead of being stored
in a single location, the key is divided into multiple parts and distributed across the user's
devices and our Auth Network. This means that the key is always available and never in danger of
being compromised.

The traditional Web3Auth SDK uses threshold signatures to dynamically reconstruct the key in the
frontend. However, with the new Web3Auth MPC (Multi Party Computation) architecture, this is no
longer necessary. Instead, partial keys are stored in different locations, and the user's device is
used to make partial signatures for messages and transactions.

These partial signatures are then combined using the TSS (Threshold Signature Scheme) to create a
final signature, which can be used to make a transaction on the blockchain. The result is a more
secure and user-friendly authentication process that helps to protect against key theft and other
types of security breaches.

The Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) is a cryptographic primitive for distributed key generation and
signing. The use of TSS in Web3Auth's Auth Network is a new paradigm that can provide numerous
benefits, especially in terms of security.

As you can notice in this diagram above, the final output, i.e., the User's TSS Account, is
generated in multiple stages within the infrastructure. Since this is a TSS- MPC based
infrastructure, you don't get back a private key, but signatures that can be used to make
transactions on the blockchain. Let's understand each of these stages in detail.

### Factors

#### Social Login Factor

This is the primary way for a user to access their account. This step involves authentication using
a user's preferred social login provider. The idToken received from the social login provider here
is passed to the Web3Auth Auth Network to generate the TSS Shares in the Nodes. By default, these
nodes have a threshold of 3/5 that can be customized according to requirements. When a user logs in,
the Auth Network generates signatures corresponding to the TSS Shares in the nodes and returns them
to the user's end. These signatures are then used alongside other shares to generate the final TSS
Account signatures.

#### Device Factor (`index:2`)

This is the second factor used to access the user's account. This step involves the generation of a
TSS Share on the user's device and using that to generate a final signature for the TSS Account
alongside the social login factor. This ensures the user logs in using their trusted device and
maintains a proper non-custodial setup.

#### Backup Factor (`index:3`)

A user has a choice to generate as many backup factors as needed to access their account. This step
involves the generation of a TSS Share on the user's end and storing them in whichever location they
prefer. This share can be used similarly to the device share to generate a final signature for the
TSS Account alongside the social login and/or device factors.

### Threshold

The threshold is the minimum number of shares required to generate a final signature for the TSS
Account. This threshold, by default, is set to 3/5 on the Auth Network and 2/3 for the user's device
front. This ensures high availability and ease of access on both ends alongside optimum security.
Both these thresholds can be customized according to the requirements.

### Components of a Factor

#### TSS Shares

The TSS Shares are the main component needed for the generation of the final working signature of
the user. These shares are generated using distributed key generation and are stored in the Auth
Network and the user's device. Since these shares are generated using MPC, they are **never
reconstructed** and always stay decentralized and secure.

However, we have exposed a function to reconstruct the TSS Key from the shares in the SDK. This
function has been marked unsafe since there is no direct use case for it other than key exports in
the case the user wants to own it completely.

#### Metadata Key & Shares

The Metadata Key closely mimics the storage of the TSS Shares. The only difference is that the
metadata key is always reconstructed and used for its encryption/decryption capabilities. It
utilizes basic Shamir's Secret Sharing and is initially generated on a user's front end. The
metadata key is utilized for the encryption/decryption of the user metadata stored in the Web3Auth
Metadata Server.

One metadata share gives you the **read** access to the metadata server, while two or more (as the
threshold is reached) give you the **write** access.

#### Factor Keys

To enable refresh, deletion, and rotational capabilities on the `tssKey`, we also introduce
**factorKeys**. Factor Keys are randomly generated keys unique to each factor-generated user's
device and backups, like users' phones, chrome extensions, on their cloud, assisting third parties,
etc.

As share to the TSS Key and/or Metadata Key may rotate, Factor Keys allow a consistent secret to be
saved in these different locations.

## Understanding the MPC Core Kit SDK Flow

By default, for a new user, the MPC Core Kit SDK starts in a 2/2 flow. This means that the user will
have to generate a social login factor and a hashed cloud factor. This hashed cloud factor is
derived on the SDK front end and stored in the encrypted metadata server. This enables the user to
start the login process from any device without creating an MFA factor.

This is done to make sure the user can access their account from any device without having to
generate a new factor. However, this makes the initial onboarding, semi-custodial. To make the
onboarding completely non-custodial, the user can use the `enableMfa` feature to generate a device
and backup factor and delete the hashed cloud factor. This makes the user's account completely
non-custodial in 2/3 setup and enables them to access their account from any device using the backup
share. Device share is saved on a trusted device and can be used to access the account from that
device seamlessly without having to generate a new factor.

## Helper SDKs

### Common Types and Interfaces

#### [`@web3auth/base`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/base)

This package gives access to common types and interfaces for Web3Auth. This comes in handy by
providing you with a standard way of importing the values you need to work with the SDKs. We highly
recommend using it while working with Typescript.

### MPC Providers

#### [`@web3auth/ethereum-mpc-provider`](https://npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/ethereum-mpc-provider)

The `@web3auth/ethereum-mpc-provider` is a Web3Auth provider that simplifies interaction with the
EIP1193 based EVM blockchains. It is used to interact with the EVM blockchain and perform various
operations like getting user's account, balance, signing a transaction, sending a transaction etc.
