Once you've installed and successfully initialized `Web3AuthMPCCoreKit`, you can use it to
authenticate your users. Further, you can use the native provider given by Web3Auth to sign
transactions and interact with the blockchain.

Natively, the instance of `Web3AuthMPCCoreKit` (referred to as `coreKitInstance` in our examples)
returns the following functions:

**[Authentication Functions:](#authentication-functions)**

- [`loginWithOAuth()`](./authentication#log-in-with-oauth) - Logs in the user using OAuth Flow.
- [`loginWithJWT()`](./authentication#log-in-with-jwt-byoa) - Logs in the user with a JWT-based ID
  Token.
- `handleRedirectResult()` - Handles the redirect result from the OAuth Flow.
- [`inputFactorKey()`](#input-factor-key) - Inputs the Factor Key to recover the User's account in
  case they don't have enough factors.
- [`logout()`](./authentication#logging-out-the-user) - Logs out the User.

Check out the [**Authentication**](/sdk/core-kit/mpc-core-kit/authentication) section of the SDK
Reference to learn more about these functions.

:::

**[Manual Sync Function:](#manual-sync-function)**

- [`commitChanges()`](#commit-changes) - Commits the changes made to the User's account while in
  manual sync mode.

  > To use this function, you'll need to configure the manual sync in the
  > [initialization](./initialize#instantiating-web3auth) step.

:::tip Prefer using Manual Sync Mode

We recommend using the Manual Sync Mode to handle the factors and keys of the User's account. This
enables you to have a fined grained control over the API calls made to the metadata server from the
SDK.

This is especially useful when you want to handle the factors and keys of the User's account in a
more controlled manner, enabling a much faster and safer experience for the User.

During manual sync mode, you need to call the `commitChanges()` function to sync the local metadata
to the web3auth metadata server. This helps you to keep the User's account in sync with the metadata
server, after they have successfully configured everything in the local.

**[Factor Handling Functions:](#factor-handling-functions)**

account, present in the state of the SDK.

- [`enableMFA()`](#enable-mfa) - Enable MFA for the user. Deletes the Hashed Factor and generates a
  new Factor Key.

- [`getCurrentFactorKey()`](#get-current-factor-key) - Returns the current Factor Key of the User's
- [`getDeviceFactor()`](#get-device-factor) - Returns the user's device factor if available.

:::danger Note

You shouldn't create too many factors, we recommend a **maximum of 10 factors**.

## Authentication Functions

---

### [Login with OAuth](./authentication#log-in-with-oauth)

- [`loginWithOAuth()`](./authentication#log-in-with-oauth) - Logs in the user using OAuth flow.

### [Login with JWT](./authentication#log-in-with-jwt-byoa)

- [`loginWithJWT()`](./authentication#log-in-with-jwt-byoa) - Logs in the user with a JWT-based ID
  Token.

### Handle Redirect Result

- `handleRedirectResult()` - Handles the redirect result from the OAuth Flow.

### Input Factor Key

#### `inputFactorKey(factorKey: BN): Promise<void>;`

Inputs the Factor Key into the SDK. This function is used to recover the User's account using the
Factor Key. If the factor key is correct, the SDK initializes the User's account and logs them in.

If you want to change the factor key in the current state of the SDK, you can use this function.

#### Usage

```tsx
const factorKey = new BN(backupFactorKey, "hex");
await coreKitInstance.inputFactorKey(factorKey);
```

### [Logout](./authentication#logging-out-the-user)

#### `logout(): Promise<void>;`

Logs out the User from the application and clears the local storage.

- [`logout()`](./authentication#logging-out-the-user) - Logs out the User.

## Manual Sync Function

---

### Commit Changes

#### `commitChanges(): Promise<void>;`

Syncs the local metadata with the web3auth metadata server. This function is only to be used while
in manual sync mode.

#### Usage

```tsx
await coreKitInstance?.commitChanges();
```

## Factor Handling Functions

---

### Enable MFA

#### `enableMFA(enableMFAParams: EnableMFAParams): Promise<string>;`

Enables MFA for the user. It creates a device factor and stores it in the local storage. It also
creates a backup factor and returns it to the user. You can also pass a factor key that can be used
for the backup factor. If you don't pass a factor key, a new factor key will be generated.

Most importantly, this function deletes the Hashed Factor Key enabling a non-custodial flow.

#### Parameters

```js
export interface EnableMFAParams {
  /**
   * A BN used for encrypting your Device/ Recovery TSS Key Share. You can generate it using `generateFactorKey()` function or use an existing one.
   */
  factorKey?: BN;
  /**
   * Setting the Description of Share - Security Questions, Device Share, Seed Phrase, Password Share, Social Share, Other. Default is Other.
   */
  shareDescription?: FactorKeyTypeShareDescription;
  /**
   * Additional metadata information you want to be stored alongside this factor for easy identification.
   */
  additionalMetadata?: Record<string, string>;
}
export enum FactorKeyTypeShareDescription {
  HashedShare = "hashedShare",
  SecurityQuestions = "tssSecurityQuestions",
  DeviceShare = "deviceShare",
  SeedPhrase = "seedPhrase",
  PasswordShare = "passwordShare",
  SocialShare = "socialShare",
  Other = "Other",
}
```

#### Usage

```tsx
const factorKey = await coreKitInstance.enableMFA({});
const factorKeyMnemonic = keyToMnemonic(factorKey);

uiConsole(
  "MFA enabled, device factor stored in local store, deleted hashed cloud key, your backup factor key: ",
  factorKeyMnemonic,
);
```

### Create Factor

A low-level function, helps you to create a backup factor key based on the type of TSS Share you
want to create. You can pass your own factor key or let the SDK generate one for you.

#### Parameters

```tsx
export interface CreateFactorParams extends EnableMFAParams {
  /**
   * Setting the Type of Share - Device or Recovery.
   **/
  shareType: TssShareType;
}

export enum TssShareType {
  DEVICE = 2,
  RECOVERY = 3,
}

export interface EnableMFAParams {
  /**
   * A BN used for encrypting your Device/ Recovery TSS Key Share. You can generate it using `generateFactorKey()` function or use an existing one.
   */
  factorKey?: BN;
  /**
   * Setting the Description of Share - Security Questions, Device Share, Seed Phrase, Password Share, Social Share, Other. Default is Other.
   */
  shareDescription?: FactorKeyTypeShareDescription;
  /**
   * Additional metadata information you want to be stored alongside this factor for easy identification.
   */
  additionalMetadata?: Record<string, string>;
}

export enum FactorKeyTypeShareDescription {
  HashedShare = "hashedShare",
  SecurityQuestions = "tssSecurityQuestions",
  DeviceShare = "deviceShare",
  SeedPhrase = "seedPhrase",
  PasswordShare = "passwordShare",
  SocialShare = "socialShare",
  Other = "Other",
}
```

#### Usage

```tsx
const factorKey = generateFactorKey();
await coreKitInstance.createFactor({
  shareType: exportTssShareType,
  factorKey: factorKey.private,
});
```

### Delete Factor

#### `deleteFactor(factorPub: TkeyPoint): Promise<void>;`

Deletes the Factor, respective to the factorPub provided for the User's account. You can get the
factor Pubs by using the `getKeyDetails()` function.

It will throw an error if you try to delete the factor that is currently active within the state of
the SDK. Use the `inputFactorKey()` function to change the factor key in the current state of the
SDK to be able to delete that factor.

#### Usage

```tsx
const pubBuffer = Buffer.from(factorPubToDelete, "hex");
const pub = Point.fromBufferSEC1(pubBuffer);
await coreKitInstance.deleteFactor(pub.toTkeyPoint());
```

### Get Current Factor Key

#### `getCurrentFactorKey(): IFactorKey;`

Returns the current factor key in usage within the state of the SDK.

#### Usage

```tsx
const factorKey = coreKitInstance.getCurrentFactorKey();
```

### Get Device Factor

#### `getDeviceFactor(): Promise<string | undefined>`

Returns the user's device factor if available.

#### Usage

```tsx
const factorKey = await coreKitInstance!.getDeviceFactor();
```

## User & Wallet Account Functions

---

### Set TSS Wallet Index

#### `setTssWalletIndex(accountIndex: number): void;`

Sets the TSS Wallet Index for the User's account. This function can be used to deterministically
derive different wallet addresses by using account indexes. Using this function you can add
multi-address account support to your application.

:::note

As an application, you need to persist this account index in the application state.

You can either choose to persist the account index temporarily using the state variable or use a
more permanent storage like `localStorage`. Whenever you add, delete or update a share, you need to
set the account index again.

Please note, the function is only supported for secp256k1 KeyType.

:::

#### Usage

```tsx
await coreKitInstance.setTssWalletIndex(index);
```

### Get SEC1 Public Key

#### `getPubKey()`

This function returns the final secp256k1 public key of the user in a synchronous call.

:::info NOTE

When you use the `setTssWalletIndex()` function to establish your account index, a unique public key
is generated! **Remember that each account index you set will result in a different public key.**

:::

#### Usage

```ts
const pubKey = coreKitInstance.getPubKey();
```

### Get ed25519 Public Key

#### `getPubKeyEd25519()`

This function returns the final ed25519 public key of the user in a synchronous call.

:::info NOTE

When you use the `setTssWalletIndex()` function is only supported for secp256k1 key type.

:::

#### Usage

```ts
const pubKey = coreKitInstance.getPubKeyEd25519();
```
