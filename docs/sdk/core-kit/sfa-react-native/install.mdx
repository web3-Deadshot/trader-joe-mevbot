## Selecting your Workflow

In React Native, you have the choice to use one of the following workflows:

### Expo Managed Workflow

Your Expo app is built on your Expo's cloud, so you don't have control over the native modules used
in the app. Developers build managed workflow apps using `expo-cli` on their computers and a
development client on their mobile devices. Managed workflow apps typically use one or more Expo
services, such as push notifications, builds, and updates.

<ExpoWarning />

### Bare React Native Workflow

Your Bare React Native app is entirely built on your machine. In this workflow, the developer has
complete control, along with the complexity that comes with that. Configuration with `app.json` /
`app.config.js` is mostly not supported in this context; instead, you will need to configure each
native project directly with Swift/Kotlin native modules. Check out the
[troubleshooting section](/sdk/pnp/react-native/install#troubleshooting) for fixing common issues.

:::tip

You can read more about different workflows in the
[Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/archive/managed-vs-bare/).

## Installation

#### [`@web3auth/single-factor-auth-react-native`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3auth/single-factor-auth-react-native)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/single-factor-auth-react-native
```

### Adding a `Storage` Module

Now with v4, we need to pass a `Storage` parameter to the SDK, which will be used for session
management without storing the private keys of the user in the device.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="bare"
  values={[
    { label: "Expo Managed Workflow", value: "expo" },
    { label: "Bare React Native Workflow", value: "bare" },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="expo">

#### Expo Secure Store

When using our SDK with an Expo-based React Native app (aka managed workflow), you have to install
the `expo-secure-store` package as a `Storage` implementation.

```shell
npx expo install expo-secure-store
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="bare">

#### React Native Encrypted Storage

When using our SDK with a bare workflow React Native app, you have to install a `Storage`
implementation provided by react-native.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save react-native-encrypted-storage
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configuration

After you have installed the files needed for your workflow, you'll have to configure the SDK with
some additional steps to be able to use the SDK properly.

### Expo Managed Workflow

- Adding URL scheme to `app.json`

To allow the Expo-based SDK to work with exported Expo Android apps, you need to add the designated
scheme into `app.json`

```json title="app.json"
{
  "expo": {
    "scheme": "web3authexpoexample" // replace with your own scheme
  }
}
```

[these example apps](/examples?product=Core+Kit&sdk=Single+Factor+Auth+React+Native+SDK) and try it
out yourself.

:::

### Bare React Native Workflow

For the bare workflow, you need to perform additional installation steps, alongside specific
configurations for Android and iOS separately.

#### Android

- Make sure that the minimum SDK compile version in `build.gradle` is 31 or more.

```gradle title="android/build.gradle"
buildToolsVersion = "31.0.0"
minSdkVersion = 21
# highlight-next-line
compileSdkVersion = 31
# highlight-next-line
targetSdkVersion = 31
```

- Add the intent filter with `scheme` defined in your `AndroidManifest.xml`

```xml title="android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml"
<intent-filter>
  <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
  # replace with your own scheme
  # highlight-next-line
  <data android:scheme="web3authrnexample" />
</intent-filter>
```

- SDK version 31 requires you to explicitly define `android:exported="true"` in
  `AndroidManifest.xml`, check whether it is correctly present or not.

```xml title="android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml"
<activity
  android:name=".MainActivity"
  android:label="@string/app_name"
  android:configChanges="keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize|uiMode"
  android:launchMode="singleTask"
  android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"
# highlight-next-line
  android:exported="true">
```

#### iOS

- Make sure that the minimum SDK compile version in `Podfile` is 14 or more.

```Podfile title="ios/Podfile"
platform :ios, '14'
```

- Install the Cocoa Pods within your project directory.

```shell
cd ios
pod install
```

:::tip

You may refer to
**[these example apps](/examples?product=Core+Kit&sdk=Single+Factor+Auth+React+Native+SDK)** and try
it out yourself.

## Troubleshooting

### Bundler Issues: Missing Dependencies

You might face issues mentioning that certain dependencies are missing within the React Native
environment. These are node dependencies that need to be polyfilled in your application, to enable
Web3Auth functionalities. Furthermore, your bundler needs to be reconfigured to use them while
building the app. Please check out our
**[React Native Troubleshooting Guide](/troubleshooting/metro-issues)**
