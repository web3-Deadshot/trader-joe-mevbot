Providers are basically pre configured RPC clients for different blockchains. They are used to
interact with the blockchain network. Web3Auth provides you with a few common providers for the most
commonly asked chains. In case of SSS based private key providers, you can also use the private key
of the user to connect to other blockchain networks, in case of SSS based infrastructure. For MPC,
you can only use the dedicated providers provided by Web3Auth.

Currently, Web3Auth supports the following providers:

### MPC Providers

- [EIP1193 MPC Provider for EVM Compatible Chains](/sdk/providers/evm-mpc)

### Private Key Providers

- [EIP1193 Private Key Provider for EVM Compatible Chains](/sdk/providers/evm)
- [Solana Private Key Provider for Solana Blockchain](/sdk/providers/solana)
- [XRPL Private Key Provider for XRPL Blockchain](/sdk/providers/xrpl)
- [Common Private Key Provider for Other Blockchains](/sdk/providers/common)

## Base Type Reference for Web3Auth Providers

For facilitating these providers, Web3Auth exposes a `IProvider` which is a provider type helping
you make standardized RPC calls to a blockchain.

This provider contains two functions, `send` and `request`. You can find its type reference below:

```tsx
export interface IProvider extends SafeEventEmitter {
  sendAsync: <T, IProvider=> Promise<U>;
  send: <T, U>(req: JRPCRequest<T>, callback: SendCallBack<U>) => void;
  request: <T>(args: RequestArguments) => Promise<Maybe<T>>;
}

export interface JRPCRequest<T> extends JRPCBase {
  method: string;
  params?: T;
}
export interface JRPCBase {
  jsonrpc?: JRPCVersion;
  id?: JRPCId;
}
export declare type JRPCVersion = "2.0";
export declare type JRPCId = number | string | void;
export interface RequestArguments {
  method: string;
  params?: unknown[] | object;
}
```
